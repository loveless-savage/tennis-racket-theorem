Hello! This is our model of a tennis racket undergoing the Dzhanibekov effect for Physics 330. 
The main file is where most of the code is run - you'll find a plot of the racket, an animation, and a Fourier analysis of it's rotational frequency.
The flipEvent file is a function that keeps track of how often the racket has flipped/when it completes a full flip, which you can see in the plot.
